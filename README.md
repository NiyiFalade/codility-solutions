# Codility Python Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to Codility problems in Python.  
Each task is implemented in its own file with a `solution()` function and embedded test cases.  

## 📂 Structure
- `odd_occurrences.py` → OddOccurrencesInArray
- `binary_gap.py` → BinaryGap
- `from_jmp.py` → FrogJmp



- ...

## ▶️ Running Tests
Each file contains built-in test cases using Python `assert`.

To run tests for a task:
```bash
python odd_occurrences.py


If all assertions pass, you’ll see:

✅ All test cases passed!

🔗 Notes

Solutions are written in Python 3.

Each file is standalone: no external libraries required.
